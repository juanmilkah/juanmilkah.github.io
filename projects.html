  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Search Engine</b>
      <p>I developed a highly efficient search tool using Rust, designed to index and perform search queries for local files and directories. This project focuses on delivering fast search results with minimal overhead. By leveraging Rust's performance and memory safety features, I was able to optimize the indexing process and bring down search query times to an impressive 4ms, even for large datasets. This tool is tailored for local file systems and provides quick and accurate results. <a href="https://github.com/juanmilkah/indexer">github</a></p>

      <b>Password Manager</b>
      <p>A Secure Password Manager project, I built a command-line tool in Rust that provides a safe and efficient way to manage passwords across multiple platforms. Designed with a focus on privacy, the entire system operates offline, meaning no data is ever transmitted over the internet, further enhancing its security. The password manager allows users to securely store and retrieve their credentials with ease. <a href="https://github.com/juanmilkah/weep">github</a></p>

      <b>In Memory Database</b>
      <p>Built a high-performance in-memory database in Rust implementing the Redis Serialization Protocol 3.0. The database achieves impressive throughput of 100,000 concurrent reads and writes per second, utilizing efficient data structures and memory management. The system supports core Redis commands and is designed for applications requiring ultra-low latency data access. <a href="https://github.com/juanmilkah/volatix">github</a></p>
